This project showcases an end-to-end data engineering workflow using the Azure platform with a Tokyo Olympics dataset. The process includes ingesting raw data from GitHub into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 via Azure Data Factory pipelines, transforming it with Databricks, performing analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics on SQL Server, and visualizing insights with Power BI. Key visualizations include medal distribution, performance trends, athlete participation, and historical comparisons. Challenges like Azure quota issues and schema alignment were addressed to ensure a seamless pipeline.
